# Homelessness in NYC, 2016-2020 - Tableau Project

### Tableau Project: [Click Here](https://public.tableau.com/shared/RFD3SQKKY?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)


## Objectives

- To analyze the The Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress (AHAR), published by the U.S. Department of Housing and Development (HUD). 

- The Report outlines findings from the Point-in-Time (PIT) count, which surveys the number of people experiencing homelessness on a single night every January.

- The goal is to provide an overview of the trends in the homeless population in NYC shelters and the demographic information from 2016 to 2020.
- 

## Scenario

- A non-profit organization for the homeless people in New York wants to launch a new meal program for the New York City homeless shelters.

- In order to design an efficient plan, the management wants to see an overview of the US homeless population in the recent years with a focus on the homeless population that resides in New York City shelters.


## Limitations

- The major limitation of this analysis is a very fundamental one since there is no reliable nationwide homeless population counting system.

- As per the NYC homeless population data, there are two main resources provided by the U.S. Department of Housing and Development (HUD) and NYC Department of Homeless Services (DHS). However these two datasets are not consistent.

- Both datasets are heavily criticised by being misleading and also underrepresenting the homeless population. It is estimated that the annual number of homeless individuals is 3 to 10 times greater what has been published.

- This being the case, HUD data was used to conduct this analysis since it provides a nationwide dataset with greater figures than what is provided by the NYC reports.

- The problem with the HUD data, however, is that it is gathered through a single night Point in Time (PiT) count conducted every January. Due to the nature of this count, sheltered homeless population data is more reliable and is therefore, the main focus of this analysis.

- The analysisâ€™ time frame is 2016-2020 and does not include 2021 due to COVID-19 related disruptions. It excludes 2022 as well, since it has not been released yet.

- Lastly, the dataset is not an interconnected one, thus, does not allow for an in-depth analysis. Demographic figures are provided separate from each other without an intersection point.

## Key Findings

- California and New York account for more than 40 percent of all homeless people in the US.

- D.C. has the highest population adjusted rate of homelessness with ~%5.

- New York ranks second in number and third in adjusted rate. 

- California ranks fourth after population differences are taken into account.

- The distribution of female/male population in the NYC shelters is very close to being even.

- Around 60% of the individuals who stay with their families are women.

- People in families account for more than the 50% of the total sheltered population in NYC.

- Almost all individuals under 18 years old in shelters are with their families, whereas only 20% on average of the sheltered people over 24 years old are without families.

- Hispanic and Black population are disproportionately impacted by the homelessness. They make up the majority of the people in families in NYC shelters.

- Hispanic population in NYC shelters has decreased over the years from 49% in 2016 to 37% in 2020, but still holding a significantly high ratio.

- Black population is the most overrepresented among the sheltered NYC homeless population with a stable trend over the years. It accounts for ~13% of all people in the U.S., but 39% of all homeless population and 73% of the NYC homeless population in shelters.
